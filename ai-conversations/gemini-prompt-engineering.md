I started, here is my terminal log:

I think I need to update node, npm. It might just be a warning, but I like being up to date as I think it has been a while since using node. Is it just node and npm or is there another piece of software? npx?  I'm doing this on macOS. Do you know how I can check how I installed these? I think I used brew - which I like, it's quite robust and repeatable it seems.
